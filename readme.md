# Learning Path for Run Tracker Project

This document outlines the learning path and key concepts covered while working on the Run Tracker project. The project is an Android application that tracks running activities, including distance, speed, and elevation gain.

## Project Overview

Run Tracker is built using Kotlin and various Android libraries. The main features include:

- Real-time tracking of running activities
- Calculation of total distance, maximum speed, and total elevation gain
- Saving and viewing past runs
- Displaying run data on a map

## New Concepts I Learned

### General Concepts
#### 1. Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude

It seems like you might be using "idiot" in a playful or mistaken way here. Latitude, longitude, and altitude are geographical coordinates that define a location on Earth. Here's a breakdown:

* Latitude: Measures how far north or south you are from the equator (in degrees). It ranges from -90째 (South Pole) to +90째 (North Pole).
* Longitude: Measures how far east or west you are from the Prime Meridian (in degrees). It ranges from -180째 to +180째.
* Altitude: The height above sea level (usually in meters or feet).
